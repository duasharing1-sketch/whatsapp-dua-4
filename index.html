This powerful dua is for asking Allah ﷻ — by His Name Al-Sattār (The Concealer) — to conceal your sins and protect you from exposure, disgrace, or humiliation in this world and the next.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said:

“All of my Ummah will be forgiven except those who sin openly…”

Then he ﷺ explained:

“…a person sins at night, and Allah conceals it, but come morning, he says, ‘I did such-and-such last night’ — while Allah had concealed it. He removes Allah’s covering from himself.”
(Bukhari & Muslim)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Sattar (O Concealer), we ask You to grant us the concealment and covering up of our sinful acts, so that none amongst Your creation becomes aware of them. Protect us from humiliation, scorn or disgrace because of those deeds.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.

When you share this post, you’re not simply sharing a dua. You’re opening the door to millions of people making sincere dua for you — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying “Ameen” to every single one.

May Allah accept it from you, and from everyone it reaches through you.

Ameen`;
